One could remove any mention of HashiCorp in the Tao and it would be a worthy model to follow. Terraform, written in Go, is a single binary that provides the user magical powers. What is Infrastructure as Code What is Infrastructure as Code What are the benefits of Infrastructure as Code? What is immutable infrastructure and the benefits of this approach? Declarative vs Procedural Approaches Nice Summary - In many ways good configuration management principles and practices are a direct response to Click-Ops Procedural Paradigm imperative (examples as iterative) Declarative Paradigm Here it is . Behold my deploy.yaml. This is what is to be. This is the Desired State Snover/Monad Manifesto Cloud Agnosticism with Providers Enabling multi-cloud deployments is easy using Terraform The Terraform Workflow Init: Validate terraform validate and format terraform fmt (optional) Plan: Apply: Destroy: Other Cool Features terraform fmt : format your code. Built-in way to make your code more beautiful terraform graph : Visualize via a convertible text a graphical depiction of dependency. terraform output : Display outputs as created in output.tf terraform refresh refresh a resource or group of resources (options to limit refresh are supported) terraform providers See the providers that were initialized and have support Variables Declaration of variables in .tf files as well as gathered in terraform.tfvars as a best practice . Variables can have blank values {} for input and will require them or they'll error. Use the variable reserved word to create a variable block that has the following: variable \"my-status\" { description = \"How I am\" type = string default = \"Fine\" } Note that description, type and default are optional so For example, variable \"mystatus\" {} is valid Introduce variables at the command line export TF_VAR_instancetype=\"t2.nano\" terraform plan -var=\"instancetype=t2.small\" Define in a variables.tf file variable \"instancetype\" { default = \"t2.micro\" } Validattion Feature A superpower of terraform is the validation feature providing conditional validation of configuration code. In this example conditional validation of variable length being greater than 4. variable \"my-status\" { description = \"How I am\" type = string default = \"Fine\" validation { condition = length(var.my-status) > 4 error = \"There is an error in your status, my dude\" } } Use the sensitive config argument to indicate Variable Types and Constraints Base types: string, number and bool Complex Types: list, set, map, object, tuple EXAMPLE: Base Type: string variable \"os_name\" { type = string default = \"Arch\" description = \"BTW I run Arch\" } EXAMPLE: Base Type: List variable \"availability_zone_names\" { type = list(string) default = [\"us-east-2b\"] } EXAMPLE: Base Type: List variable \"docker_ports\" { type = list(object({ internal = number external = number protocol = string })) default = [ { internal = 8300 external = 8300 protocol = \"tcp\" } ] } Terraform Provisioners Best Practices include using them sparingly, opting instead for a hyperscaler service if available, when possible. Two types of Provisioners: Creation Time and Destroy Time provisioner. These can be set to run when a resource is being created or destroyed Use only when actions desired are not within Terraforms's declartive model. A Provisioner's state is not examined Only Zero return codes are valid. If a provisioner returns a non-zero return code , the resource is tainted Here's an example of a local-exec provisioner resource \"null_resource\" \"dummy_resource\" { provisioner \"local-exec\" { command = \"echo '0' > status.txt\" } provisioner \"local-exec\" { when = destroy command = \"echo '1' > status.txt\" } } Terraform State Critical for terraform operations. Without declarative state terraform doesn't work. It maps real resources to definitions in terraform code By default, state is dumped locally into terraform.tfstate but can be stored in object storage (e.g. s3 or GCS) Before any infrastructure is modified, terraform checks the existing state file is up to date with the existing infrastructure Resource dependency metatdata is tracked in the state-file. Dependencies for providers (subnet before ec2 launch is completely handled in terraform) The statefile also caches resource attributes, making it more performant and less chatty. So much of the data it will need and What does the terraform state command do? It is a utility for manipulating and managing the state of resources Advanced state management allows for manual removal of resources that will remove it from terraform management List out the tracked resources in terraform via terraform state list List out the tracked resources in terraform via terraform state show List out the tracked resources in terraform via terraform state rm $RESOURCE Local and Remote State and Storage Use AWS S3 or GCS bucket to persist state and allow for collaboration.

Use a hierarhical structure to organize e.g. providers/vpc Other Cool Features : Built-In Functions Pre-packaged built-in functions allow to transform and combine values The join function can be used to join together variables and resources Useful functions include: file function for inserting or manipulating files timestamp() will provide a UTC timestamp min(6,2,3,4) or max(82,88,19) to finnd the same To find if a string is contained within use contains([\"configparm1\",configparm2\", config3,625,23], \"config3\") This will return a boolean value of true or false Variable Type Constraints Variable Type Constraints control the type of variable values they are Primitive and Complex Primitive: includes single type value: number, string, bool (e.g. 15,\"Production\",True) Complex Type Constraints are: list, tuple, map, object These represent multiple types in a single variable Complex types can be further divided into two types of Constructors. The first is a Collection which allows multiple values of one primitive to be grouped together. Examples of these are: list(type) map(type) set(type) Complex Type: Structural Variable Another Complex type: allows for multiple types (num,string,bool) in the variable value.
